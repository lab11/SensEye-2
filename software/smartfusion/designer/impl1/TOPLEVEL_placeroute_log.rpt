Warning: PLC503: Instance MSS_CORE2_0/MSS_ADLIB_INST_RNILH8/U_CLKSRC/U_GL is using the A2F500M3G
         fabric CCC/PLL GLA output.
         This resource is using the glitchless mux (NGMUX) connected to the GLA output of the
         fabric CCC/PLL. In order for the NGMUX to operate correctly, the signal driving this
         instance must be a free-running clock signal.
         Refer to SmartFusion Microcontroller Subsystem User Guide for more details.
         Verify that this signal is a continuous clock signal.
